# The Fibonacci Exercise

[Fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci) was an Italian mathematician who came up with the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number):

&nbsp;
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 ...

Where every number is the sum of the two previous ones.

&nbsp;
e.g. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 comes from:

&nbsp;
0 + 1 = 1

&nbsp;
1 + 1 = 2

&nbsp;
1 + 2 = 3

&nbsp;
2 + 3 = 5

&nbsp;
.

&nbsp;

Create a function `fibonacciGenerator (n)` to get the sequence of `n` elements as the output.
